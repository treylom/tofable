# Rules INDEX — situation router (always-loaded)

> The only part of the rule layer that stays in context permanently. Before acting, scan the trigger column; when a row matches, read that rule file and apply it. Rule bodies live in the files, not here.

| When you are about to… | read | one-line gist |
|---|---|---|
| claim work is done / verified / passing | [verification.md](verification.md) | evidence before claims; state the grade; verify the verifier; quotes & batches checked mechanically |
| hand work to a sub-agent / worker / other bot | [delegation.md](delegation.md) | complete HOW up front; check capacity; ack ≠ execution; parallel delegates verified per-delegate |
| stop, defer, or wrap up with goals remaining | [continuation.md](continuation.md) | real blocker? whose call? reported? — triage waiting/hung/dead |
| deploy a watcher / write a value another automation reads | [automation.md](automation.md) | self-test on real data variants; exclude yourself; check the consumer's schema, not your memory |
| act on a compressed option label, conflicting directives, or a literal path | [instruction-fidelity.md](instruction-fidelity.md) | restate your reading before spending; literal paths used literally |
| invoke a skill with a written, machine-checkable output spec (or add one) | [skill-contracts.md](skill-contracts.md) | a written spec isn't enforcement; register an output contract, don't just prose it harder |
| edit code or config | *(write your own — e.g. blast-radius check before, 3-step verify after)* | |
| write to shared storage / publish externally | *(write your own — e.g. independent review gate before anything public)* | |
| assert something "doesn't exist / is broken" | *(write your own — e.g. widen the search before concluding absence)* | |

Conflict priority, when a rule and an instruction disagree: **explicit user instruction > rule file > default behavior.**
