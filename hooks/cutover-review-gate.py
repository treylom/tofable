"""Stop — cutover review gate.

Behavior: if the last assistant turn *declares* a cutover/deploy/go-live as
completed, but no reviewer verdict (PASS/GREEN in a review context) is
recorded anywhere in the session transcript, emit
{"decision":"block","reason":...} once to bounce the Stop — asking the
agent to record (or actually obtain) the review verdict first.

Why: "solo deploys" are a recurring friction class — an agent ships a UI or
service change and announces completion while the designated reviewer's
verdict exists nowhere in the session. A completion *declaration* is cheap;
this gate makes the declaration require recorded evidence, in the same
spirit as the verify-gate ("done" needs verification after the change).

Scope guards against false positives:
- only fires on completion-tense declarations ("cutover complete",
  "deployed", "went live") — plans/questions ("will deploy tomorrow") pass;
- any reviewer verdict seen earlier in the session (including inbound
  messages from reviewer bots/humans) satisfies the gate;
- capped at one bounce per turn via stop_hook_active; fail-open on any
  parse error or missing transcript.

Known limitation (2026-07-13 rereview): verdict satisfaction is
session-scoped — this hook is stateless over the transcript, so a verdict
recorded for an earlier deploy also satisfies a later declaration in the
same session. Sessions carrying multiple distinct deploys should obtain a
fresh verdict per deploy. (Narrowing this would bounce the common
"reviewer PASS → owner says proceed → deploy → declare" flow, a worse
trade.)
