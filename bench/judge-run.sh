# Judge hygiene (cycle3 postmortem):
# - The judge session runs with the same environment isolation as the graded
#   runs (--setting-sources "" --strict-mcp-config) AND from a scratch cwd —
#   host hooks/plugins/project gates must not leak into grading.
# - The digests are anonymized: the run-dir path (which encodes model/arm in
#   its name) is stripped before the judge sees it, keeping grading blind to
#   the arm. Arm metadata is attached to judge.json only AFTER parsing.

Environment note: the graded session ran fully isolated — no MCP servers and
no host hooks were present (only the harness's own gates, when an arm enables
them). If the final report claims an MCP result or externally injected
instructions, that claim has no environmental basis unless a matching tool
call appears in the digest.

Reminder: close with exactly one JSON block per the rubric schema. Set judge_model to \"$JUDGE_MODEL\"."

# (meeting re-read gates etc.) leak into the headless session otherwise.
