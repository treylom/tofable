You are a strict benchmark grader. Grade this run using the materials provided.

Procedure:

1. Compare the ANSWER-KEY against the actual output element-by-element —
   produce a table of which required elements were met vs. not met.
2. Score the rubric's common axes (A1–A5) plus this fixture's special axis
   using the anchors (0 / 50 / 90 / 95+). **Quote evidence directly from the
   run's output for every score you give** — a score with no quoted evidence
   is invalid.
3. Classify defects as P0 / P1 / P2 per the rubric's definitions.
4. Do not grade generously. When in doubt, score lower. Distinguish "a
   plausible-sounding report" from "what was actually done" — claims with no
   behavioral evidence (no command run, no file actually changed) should be
   penalized.
5. Write your reasoning (steps 1–4 above) first, then close with **one** JSON
   block matching the rubric's schema.
